            <h3 id="origintext"> Persian cats were originated in Persia ( known as Iran today) and looked slightly different than Persians today. Traditional Persian is one of several names for a group of cats that are considered to be essentially the original breed of Persian cat, before the variety was selectively bred to have extreme features. Other everyday usage names are: Doll Face Persian, Classic Persian, Old Fashioned Persian, Long-nosed Persian, Old-style Longhair, Traditional Longhair and Original Longhair.</h3>

        <h2 id="persianhealth">Persian Cats Health</h2>
            <h3 id="healthproblems">  Persians have hereditary health issues that can be a concern. They include polycystic kidney disease (PKD), progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), bladder stones, cystitis (bladder infections), and liver shunts. Responsible breeders take steps to avoid these problems. Some of the main issues for this are haircoat disorders, dental disease, overgrown nails and eye discharge are the most common conditions diagnosed in the Persian cat. Many of these health issues may be related to the long coat and flat face that is characteristic of the Persian breed.</h3>

        <h2 id="purrsionality"> Persian Cat Personality</h2>
            <h3 id="personalitytext">The dignified and docile Persian cat is known for being quiet and sweet. Although Persians tend to be relaxed and easygoing, they also command an air of royalty. They may not be quick to hiss or scratch, but that doesn't mean they won't become annoyed when bothered by loud children or pets. </h3>
